Five of the test inputs for Problem A were retracted after the contest
because they did not satisfy the problem specification.  All of the
submissions from the contest were re-tested without the retracted
test inputs. The re-testing did not change any of the judgements. All
submissions that failed on the incorrect inputs also failed in the same
way on some other correct input.
